Description:
This is my first attempt to make addon. It is not perfect. There may be some bugs or lua errors.

IT INCLUDED THE ADDON Parkour SWEP.

Gamemode developed to escape nextbot.
The server owner can be found in nextbotrun/gamemode/config/sv_config, it's config file.

The gamemode can spawn Nextbot with random amount, also can respawn nextbot every time.

How To Run?
1.Put the nextbotrun folder in gamemodes into garrysmod/gamemodes.
2.Write +gamemode nextbotrun into your server startup .bat file.
3.Run the .bat file.

Additional Step:
if you are using English language, please rename the nextbotrun/gamemode/config/cl_config_ENGLISH_PLZ RENAME IT TO cl_config or it'll not work.lua to cl_config.lua.
OR THE LANGUAGE WILL BE CHINESE.
